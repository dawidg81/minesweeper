# minesweeper

Welcome to minesweeper. This is documentation of this small project.

## Locations of archivization

The source code can be found on [Github](https://github.com/dawidg81/minesweeper).
The same source code, often less updated and synchronized with the original on GitHub, can be found on [githost](http://81net.duckdns.org/githost/minesweeper.git) at [81net](http://81net.duckdns.org/).
81net is less professionaly mainted website than GitHub. minesweeper on githost is only a mirror of what is being originally developed on GitHub.

## About

minesweeper has been written by [dawidg81](https://github.com/dawidg81).
The project is being written in [C++](https://isocpp.org/) ([GNU Compiler Collection](https://gcc.gnu.org/)) and handled by [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/).

## Documentation

The documentation is powered by [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).
There may be [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) extension plugged in.

### Where

Locations where you can find this documentation is mainly in `docs` directory of the minesweeper's source code. It should be also available at GitHub deployed pages, set for the mainstream development.
It is not guaranteed, but maybe it will be also hosted on 81net website. Noticing again that 81net website is unstable and may be not online everytime.

### Why

The documentation is here to documentate everything about the minesweeper project. Since the project is really small, compared to other repositories I've seen, there is not really much to write about this project.
The main goal of the documentation is to give the user all instructions how to use the program easily, to make the user understand everything in the program. The side goal of this documentation is to documentate the code
for potential developers. Although the project is not any popular and so far there is no interest in it across other programmers, it will remain some goal for this documentation, just in case. The code documentation will
describe and explain everything about the source code of minesweeper (classes, functions, etc.), as much with details as it can.
