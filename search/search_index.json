Concept There are going to be 3 difficulties and one additional option where user can determine plot size and amount of mines by himself. Game commands are going to be read from normal std::cin input method. The project is not going to use curses, ncurses or lncurses libraries for now. Plot is going to be displayed (printed) on the upper left side of the screen, eventually with colors. Here are planned symbols of in-game elements: # - unrevealed tile. . - revealed tile (no mines around). X - (red color) bomb. Colorful numbers from 1 (1 mine around the revealed tile) to (maximum) 8 (8 mines around the revealed tile) - numbers saying how much mines are around it.","title":"About"},{"location":"#about","text":"A reimplementation of minesweeper game in C++ in terminal.","title":"About"},{"location":"#concept","text":"There are going to be 3 difficulties and one additional option where user can determine plot size and amount of mines by himself.

Game Game class is operating on game logic, display and usage. Global variables Public editDiff() A function of type int . Responsible for providing interface letting user edit custom game parameters (fourth difficulty option). Uses methods from Utils class. Detailed specification of this function is int editDiff() . initDiff() A function of type void . This function sets game parameters ( boardWidth , boardHeight , mines ) to specified value depending on gived difficulty value diff (type int ). The function requires a diff parameter of type int . Full specification of declaration of this function is void initDiff(int diff) . First difficulty is Easy with diff value of 0, second difficulty is Medium with diff value of 1, third difficulty is Hard with diff value of 2, fourth difficulty is Custom with diff value of 3. On Custom difficulty given, editDiff() is being called. Plot width, which means how much cells wide is the plot, is declared as boardWidth . The same with boardHeight . Amount of mines randomly placed in cells is declared as mines . These three variables are a type of int and are being properly set by initDiff() function. For Easy difficulty, all three variables are set to value 9 , which means that the plot is 9 cells wide and high, with 9 bombs randomly spread across the plot.","title":"Classes"},{"location":"code/classes/#classes","text":"The code is mostly being structured in classes.","title":"Classes"},{"location":"code/classes/#game","text":"Game class is operating on game logic, display and usage.","title":"Game"},{"location":"code/classes/#global-variables","text":"","title":"Global variables"},{"location":"code/classes/#public","text":"","title":"Public"},{"location":"code/classes/#editdiff","text":"A function of type int .
